The group worked very well together as usual, we started very early with the assignment and thought getting feedback on the work done would be crucial to get this assignment done. we wanted to do the first procedure together to understand how everything worked and then distribute the rest to individual members, however that was not possible due to duplication of data on the same procedure. So, it was decided that everyone should take one procedure each and then the rest should be done together in group meetings

Eirik had the responsibility of finishing at least i_giving_level_sp, and that procedure was done in time and is working just fine.

Shiwan took the i_account procedure and finished it in time and the procedure was to our satisfactory.

Daniel: du skal fylle dette.

The other procedures were done in group and lab meetings. Everything has been gone through several times and checked by martin to confirm things are the way they are supposed to be.
To summarize the group work is going very well, we would like to continue this way so that everyone understands how advanced databases works.
