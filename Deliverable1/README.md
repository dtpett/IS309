## SQL Script
See SQL file in this folder.

## Work done by group members
Each group member worked toghether on creating the ER-diagram. We usually book rooms with screens so that everyone can contribute. 

When finished we decided to make tables in the database and generate a relational model in SQL developer to see the relationship between the entities. We showed this to Martin to get feedback. Based on the feedback we got we were ready to generate the DDL to create the database tables and constraints. We used insert queries to add data to each entity, to ensure that everything worked as it should. Once again we went to Martin to receive feedback. 

We are satisfied with how we have worked together. All three group members have worked the last semester with databases, so we continue with this same group this semester. We always make sure every member takes part in the discussions and contributes to the project.
